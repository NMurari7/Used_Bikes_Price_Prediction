## Used Bike Price Prediction
This is a used bike price prediction project built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Streamlit. It predicts the price of a bike based on the bike model, kms driven, and year of manufacturing. The dataset used in this project is scraped from droom.in.

## Installation
To install the required packages, run the following command:

pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is scraped from droom.in. It contains information about used bikes, including their models, year of manufacturing, kms driven, and other details. The dataset is preprocessed before training the model.

## Usage
To run the application, simply run the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. From there, you can enter the details of the bike such as model, kms driven, and year of manufacturing and the app will predict the price of the bike.

## Development
This application was developed using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Streamlit. The code is organized into several files:

To run app.py 
open terminal and type
streamlit run app.py
